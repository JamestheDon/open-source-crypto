<h1 align="center"> Building a more technical referance model around emerging cryptosystem technology.</h1>

# State of _The_ Industry

Technologies are fragile early in their evolutinoary lifecycle, unfortunately this Industry is full of content that underminds peoples confidence in it or is too complex to understand. Crypto needs more groups of people exploring and documenting its potential.

## :trophy: The goal

A model around cryptosystems to aid in the comprehension and comparison of quality and performance within these systems.

Create a resource to shead light on the impact of crypto-technologies by sharing knowledge and knowhow with **the** Industry.

## :pencil2: How to Contribute

Add definitions, expand with explanatory & exploratory content about distributed systems, networking, communications.
